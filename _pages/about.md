I'm a physical oceanographer and postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working under [Jinbo Wang](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/jwang2) and [Ben Hamlington](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/bhamling/). I received my doctorate in oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (2016-2023),
University of California, San Diego.
I was supported for part of my studies by NASA through the [Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7B913A7DEE-2747-6539-130C-0AB1E2322F42%7D&path=future&method=init) grant.

At SIO, I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Sarah Gille](http://pordlabs.ucsd.edu/sgille/), [Bruce Cornuelle](http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/bcornuelle), and [Matt Mazloff](http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/mmazloff/). I could not imagine a better trio of scientists to guide me through my studies.
