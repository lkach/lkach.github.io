<!-- Website under development as of May 2025 -->

I'm a physical oceanographer and postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working under [Jinbo Wang](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/jwang2) and [Ben Hamlington](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/bhamling/). I received my doctorate in oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (2016-2023),
University of California, San Diego.
I was supported for part of my studies by NASA through the [Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7B913A7DEE-2747-6539-130C-0AB1E2322F42%7D&path=future&method=init) grant.

At SIO, I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Sarah Gille](http://pordlabs.ucsd.edu/sgille/), [Bruce Cornuelle](http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/bcornuelle), and [Matt Mazloff](http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/mmazloff/). I could not imagine a better trio of scientists to guide me through my studies.

Research Interests
======
My research broadly focuses on the remote sensing of physical oceanographic phenomena. In my postdoc at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), I have been working towards validating [SWOT](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/) data against other observations, with one project focusing on steric height from in situ moorings, and another comparing currents derived from SWOT with surface currents from the coastal [HF radar network](https://cordc.ucsd.edu/projects/hfrnet/). [In grad school](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3q94p7xw) I focused on questions about diurnal-and-faster coastal processes, such as “how predictable are tidal currents?” and “how coherent are diurnal currents and winds?”. Broadly, I’m interested in the complicated dynamics that exist near coasts and how much of that variability we can observe.
